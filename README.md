# 🧪 Water Quality Status of River Yamuna (Delhi) – 2013 to 2024

This project analyzes the water quality of the Yamuna River in Delhi from 2013 to 2024 using real data sourced from the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) website. 

The objective is to track pollution trends, compare values with water quality standards, and identify critical hotspots along the river to support environmental restoration efforts.
